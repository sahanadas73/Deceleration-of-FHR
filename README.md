# Deceleration-of-FHR
We have used CTU-CTG open access dataset obtained from Physionet.
Deceleration was identified based on NICHD guideline and the three event points were detected.
Corresponding uterine contraction and their event points are also noted.
Spatial and temporal relationships between the uterine contraction and the deceleration are used to classify the deceleration.
